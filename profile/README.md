# PeARS, the people's search engine

Welcome to the organisation for the PeARS project! Here, you can find out more about the different flavours of PeARS we are working on.

* *PeARS Federated* is a decentralised PeARS. It allows admins to create mini search engines on topics of their choice, and invite contributors to crowdsource the content of the index. Search can happen on any of the managed PeARS instances. The alpha version of *PeARS Federated* is very close to being released, so keep an eye on it!

* *PeARS Lite* is a search engine that you can run locally from your browser. It allows you to 'index' pages (i.e. to produce a computer-readable representation of the pages' content, essential to the search process), and to search pages that you or your friends have indexed. Search happens entirely on your machine, meaning that no one knows what you are searching and when. *PeARS Lite* is under continuous development and is meant to be integrated with Federated so that the work of data curation can benefit both local and instance users.

* *PeARS Orchard* is the original version of PeARS, which aims at building a fully distributed search engine. It is still under heavy development.

* *PeARS OMD* is a cooperation with the private cloud provider [On My Disk](https://onmydisk.com/), adding search capability to the original solution. The first phase of the project has now ended and we are in beta-testing. A new phase (2024-2025) is now starting to include website hosting to the solution: your website, on your own machine, no need for a cloud service.
